# These settings affect the behaviors of your sumobot, such as how fast it moves and
#   how wide of an arc it searches.

MAX_SPEED = 1 # Ranges from 0 (doesn't move at all) to 1 (as fast as possible)

TURN_DURATION = 0.2 # Number of seconds that the bot spends turning.

WAITING_TIME = 5 # DO NOT CHANGE THIS VALUE! It is the time your bot waits to start battling and must be the same for all bots
